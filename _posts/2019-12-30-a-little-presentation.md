description: I had the opportunity to do a little presentation about software architecture in php applications.
---

Two weeks ago I did a little presentation for a few people. I got asked by an old friend of mine who works currently as 
lead developer in a small agency near vienna. He wanted someone outside of the agency to address and discuss some coding 
quality and architectural issues on their PHP applications. 

Those who know me, are aware I have some strong opinions about several *best practises* and in general about architecture 
of a PHP application. But I never had to present my approaches and opinions in front of strangers and justify them.
Therefor, I have to admit, I was a little nervous even if it was a relative small audience.

I'm a fan of [Extremly defensive PHP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS0Nn_ncH-8){:target="_blank"} by 
[Marco Pivetta (Ocramius)](https://github.com/Ocramius){:target="_blank"}. So my talk was a lot inspired by the 
topics covered in Marco Pivetta's presentation such as the usage of the final keyword. I mixed it with some
general topics like dependency injection, some other design pattern like the adapter and proxy pattern and of course
unit tests.

Feedback about the presentation was quite good. I guess i will revise the presentation and do it again with a different
audience.
